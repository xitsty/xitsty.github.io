<h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
<p>Below is different showcase of projects I have been working on and a short description of what they do</p>
<h2>C# Chatbot</h2>
<h3>Description of it</h3>
<p>This here a Chatbot / Bot that is written in C# and works on a basic level at the moment. 
    It starts with a login sequence to confirm what the user is allowed to do and not to do. 
    After login, it moves over to a menu where the user can choose what it wants to do. 
    Games, Support and Music isn't fully implemented yet, There is feature of Games that works and is described further down.

<p>A Magic 8ball app written in C#, it is at the moment a very basic console app, plan is to implement it with bot described above</p>

<h2>Python Poker game</h2>
<h3>Description of it</h3>
<p>A Poker game made in python one of my first project and only one made in python. 
    It is basic working, uses a hashing algorithm that uses datetime to make a shuffle of the deck, 
    uses down to millisecond to ensure that no duplicate deck can be made. 
    It then stores the hashing seed used in a json file to it can be accessed later, 
    to ensure players what happen and no cheating was involved.
    Plan to make it over into C# and implement it with the Bot. 
    It only so fair deals the cards to the wanted player number and then tells who win.</p>
<a>Video coming...</a>
