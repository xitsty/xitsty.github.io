<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
<p>Here you’ll find some of the projects I’ve worked on, each with a short description of what they do and what I learned while building them.</p>

<h2>C# Chatbot</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This is a chatbot I built in C#. Right now, it’s fairly simple but already has a working login system to manage user access.
    After logging in, users get a menu where they can choose different features.
    Some parts like Games, Support, and Music are still in progress, but one of the game features already works.
    The bot can also remember basic user details like name and age, which are added during the conversation.</p>

<h2>C# Magic 8 Ball</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A small console app inspired by the classic Magic 8 Ball toy, built in C#.
    It’s simple but fun, and the plan is to later connect it with the chatbot as one of its modules.</p>
<a>Video Coming Soon...</a>

<h2>Python Poker Game</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This was one of my very first projects in Python.
    It’s a basic poker game that uses a datetime-based hashing algorithm to shuffle the deck down to the millisecond,
    making sure no two decks are ever the same.
    The seed is saved in a JSON file so results can be checked later, which adds a bit of fairness and transparency.
    Right now, the game deals cards to the chosen number of players and figures out the winner.
    I’d like to rebuild it in C# in the future and tie it into the chatbot as well.</p>
<a>Video Coming Soon...</a>
